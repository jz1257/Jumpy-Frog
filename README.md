# Jumpy-Frog

Jumpy Frog is an arcade-style mobile game inspired by the once massively popular Flappy Bird. 
The objective of the game is simply to evade obstacles by tapping to make the frog jump. The game was
built using SpriteKit, utilizing SpriteKit's support for game nodes and game physics, with each object node
interacting via collection detection and proximity detection.
